# desmos-keymap

This app, powered by the Desmos API and Bootstrap, captures the ASCII (`https://theasciicode.com.ar/`) codes  of the keyboard strokes and injects those values into the Graphing Calculator state present on the screen. Users can build Desmos graphs that incorporate these ASCII values and test them here.

## Technologies Used

- Desmos API
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- HTML
- CSS

## Getting Started

Because this is a static webpage, to get started with the project, simply navigate here: `https://asamrodcky.github.io/desmos-keymap/`.

## How to Use

The Desmos Keyboard Mapping App is very simple to use. You can create Desmos graphs (here: `https://www.desmos.com/calculator`) that incorporate the use of the keyboard ASCII codes and paste their URLs directly in the input field in the top right corner of the page to test how your graph would function with different keyboard mappings.

## Development Process

This project was built using basic HTML, CSS, as well as Bootstrap. All of the logic was implemented using JavaScript and jQuery. The app has a single index page and JavaScript file that manages the state of the app, including the setting and clearing of the graph states, example navigation, and keystroke capture.

## Conclusion

This project was built to learn about the capabilities and limitations of the Desmos API as well as the possibilites of what a Desmos player _could_ incorporate. It is a simple web app, but it demonstrates how to send, recieve and update API states. With this project, you can learn how to build more complex applications using the Desmos API and more robust event handling/user autonomy.
